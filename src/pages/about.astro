  <p>
    My name is Ondřej Konečný, and I am currently a product designer at
    CloudTalk. I originally come from a small village called Prušánky, but I
    have been living and working in Prague.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find me designing user interfaces or coding what I designed. This
    means that my work involves a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and its
    frameworks), but I&nbsp;also use design tools and methodologies. I am
    passionate about the intersection of design and engineering.
