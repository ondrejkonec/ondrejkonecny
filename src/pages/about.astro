    Hi, my name is Ond≈ôej. I love exploring web technologies and enjoy working on the border between design and engineering since high school. This mean that you can find me designing user interfaces or coding what I designed. My work involves a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and its
    frameworks), but I&nbsp;also use design tools and methodologies.
