How do you work effectively with CSS so that you feel comfortable with every modification? In this article, you will find a very brief overview of the development of CSS writing and description of the most common problems.

## A little history

In 1994, Håkon Wium Lie realized that there was a need to create a language that would create ways to visually edit documents on the web. The main idea was based on the need to separate the content from the presentation. Lie, together with other designers, created the first version of CSS, which over time was implemented by all browsers. After HTML, CSS became the second standardized language for W3.

This [archived e-mail communication](http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1994q1/0648.html) shows the origins of the idea of visual editing of HTML documents. As you can see, after pasting the same HTML, the content was displayed differently on two different browsers (Netscape and Mosaic). The developers of the Mosaic browser decided to add an indent from above before the list (now known as an unordered list). They just thought it would look better. Everyone then perceived it as a bug and this resulted in the need to have control over how their content appeared on the web.
