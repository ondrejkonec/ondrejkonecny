  <h2>Hi, I’m Ondřej. Designer based in Prague, Czech Republic. Currently working at CloudTalk.</h2>
  <p>My work involves a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also have plenty of experience with several design tools and methodologies. I love exploring web technologies and I enjoy working on the border between design and engineering.</p>
